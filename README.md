Method of Submitting Requests

All beta testers are requested to create an account on GitHub, if they do not already have one. Once logged in, you will go to the following URL in order to submit bugs:
https://github.com/cryptokingdom/CK_Beta/issues

You can click on "New Issue" to create an issue, or use this direct link: https://github.com/cryptokingdom/CK_Beta/issues/new

All requests will fall into one of the following categories:

Bug, Feature Improvement, or Feature Request. 

When submitting a request please is clear as to which category your request falls into.
This will be accomplished by using the words Bug, Improvement or Request, as the first word in the title of the logged issue. E.g. Bug: Missing Attribute

When reporting a bug, please provide a precise recap of your actions. This allows the development team to replicate your experienced issue, and speeds up resolution. 

When submitting a request for a feature improvement, please provide as much detail as you can on how you would like the current feature to be change. 
When submitting requests for additional features, please explain why a feature should be considered for the game, and a brief guide on your proposed implementation. Remember that any request made by testers can be considered, but might be implemented in a different way.

Schedule

Beta testing will commence Monday 10th of August at 8pm (GMT+2), for a period of 2 weeks. 

Please try and be as natural in your actions as possible as this allows game experience bugs to also be identified. Remember to have fun, and provide as much feedback as you can.
